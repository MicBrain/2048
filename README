Version 1.0 6/30/2014.

This directory contains a skeleton for CS61B Project 0.

Although some of what's in here might seem mysterious to you, try to 
understand what it's all for.  Don't be afraid to ask us about it.

GENERAL NOTE:  EVERYTHING in these files is changeable as you see fit, unless
   otherwise noted.  Your task is to conform to the spec, period.  While
   we have suggested, with these files, certain points about the design, we
   don't require any of it.  

CONTENTS:
---------

README                 This file.  You need not turn this in.
        
Makefile               For those of you using the standard Unix tool chain
                       rather than Eclipse, this file provides for some
                       simple compilation/testing control.  See the 
                       comments in it for the targets provided.  Those of
                       you using Eclipse will need it on the instructional
                       machines (the commands 'make' and 'make check' must
                       work correctly on your submission, regardless of
                       which editor or IDE you used).

staff-version          If we update the skeleton, this file will contain a
                       unique version id indicating what version of the
                       skeleton is currently in use.

    Makefile           A Makefile for compiling, style checking, testing, and
                       cleaning up files in this directory.
                        
    Main.java          Entry point to program. You can complete the assignment
                       by modifying only this file if you want, but you may
                       add others.

    gui/               Directory containing a subpackage that displays a
                       board and handles I/O.  You should not modify the
                       contents of this directory (if you do, your
                       modifications will be discarded for grading purposes).

tests/                 Directory with integration test machinery.

    tester.py          A Python 3 script for testing your program.  It makes
                       use of the --testing option in your program to feed
                       in known moves.
    testing.py         A module that supports testing in general.

    



MERGING CHANGES:
----------------

If and when we publish new versions of the skeleton, you may want to 
incorporate those changes in your project.  This is known as "merging".
Basically, it works like this:

   0. Commit your current files (as with 'hw commit'). NEVER start
      merging files until you have done this successfully!!!
   1. Compute the set of differences between the version of the skeleton
      from which your current code comes and the current version of the
      skeleton.
   2. Try to apply these differences to your current code.
   3. Where the changes in the skeleton overlap your changes, there are
      "merge conflicts".  Edit the files containing these conflicts and
      resolve the conflict as appropriate.
   4. When done, mark the files as no longer being conflicted.
   5. Commit the new version of your files.  Again, NEVER do
      additional editing until you have successfully committed.

This process is so common that all widely used version-control systems
support it with one or more commands.  In Subversion, this is the 'svn
merge' command.  Rather than have you confront this directly, we've
introduced the command 'mergeskel' to do steps 1 and 2 and
'resolveskel' to do step 4.  So,

   A. Put yourself in your project working directory first.
   B. Commit any changes (hw commit)
   C. Run mergeskel
   D. Edit out any conflicts (hw status will tell you which files 
      have conflicts).
   E. Run resolveskel, which tells Subversion that the conflicts are 
      fixed (it otherwise will not let you commit.)
   F. Commit the results.

If you have files lying around with names like "FOO.merge-right.r1234", you
haven't resolved something.

The rest of this section explains the full version of what's really
going on (you can skip it, but it's good to know).  We store copies of
all versions of the skeleton in staff repository files called (on the
instructional machines)

       $STAFFREPOS/tags/projN-V

where projN is the project (e.g., proj1) and V is a version number
(starting at 0).  The current version of the skeleton is in

       $STAFFREPOS/projN

The file staff-version in your project directory, if present, contains the
the tag name of that skeleton (if it isn't present, the tag name is projN-0,
as in proj1-0).

In a project working directory, say proj1, after committing all your
current files, you (or mergeskel) merge in a new version of the
skeleton (on the instructional machines) by first figuring out (using
staff-version, if present) what was the last version you updated to.
Suppose this is proj1-0.  Now you enter the commands

        svn merge --accept=postpone $STAFFREPOS/tags/proj1-0 $STAFFREPOS/proj1

This produces some progress messages, possibly including some messages
about conflicts.  If there are no conflicts, you can simply commit your files
and you are done.

Otherwise, each file with conflicts will have sections like this

    <<<<<<< .working
         System.out.println ("Welcome to my project");
         initialize ();
    =======
         initialize (args);
    >>>>>>> .merge-right.r1009

The part before the ======= was in your file to start with.  The part after 
======= is from the updated version of the skeleton.  Choose which you
want to use, or what combination you want to use and edit accordingly.
Then remove the marker lines (<<<<, >>>>, ====) and save.  Do this for 
all conflicted files.  Finally, you (or resolveskel) can run the command 

    svn resolved --accept working <FILE>

for each <FILE> you have resolved in this way.  If you've done this
right, 'hw status' will no longer show conflicts (just modified
files).  Now commit your work and you're done.
