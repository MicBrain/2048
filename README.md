# 2048 (Video Game)
==================================================================================================================================

### Description

   2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. It can be regarded as a type of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the Threes! app released a month earlier. 
   
   The game has been described by the Wall Street Journal as "almost like Candy Crush for math geeks", and Business Insider called it "Threes on steroids". Due to the massive popularity of 2048, many people now mistakenly believe Threes! to be a clone of it, rather than the other way around. The fact that the game runs on open-source code has led to many additions to the original game, including a score leaderboard and improved touchscreen playability. Spinoffs have been released online, as apps and for the Nintendo 3DS, and include versions with elements from Doge, Doctor Who, Flappy Bird and Tetris; there has also been a 3D version[4] and ones with bigger or smaller grids. Cirulli sees these as "part of the beauty of open source software" and does not object to them "as long as they add new, creative modifications to the game".
   
### Gameplay

   2048 is played on a simple gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
